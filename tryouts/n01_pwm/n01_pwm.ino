  Use a button on port 2 to trigger LED feade in on 3 Ports (9-11) in a row

  The circuit:
   LEDs attached from pin 9-11 to ground
   pushbutton attached from pin 2 to +5V
   10K resistor attached from pin 2 to ground

// will quickly become a bigger number than can be stored in an int.

  // check to see if you just pressed the button
  // (i.e. the input went from LOW to HIGH),  and you've waited
  // long enough since the last press to ignore any noise:

      buttonState = reading;

      // only toggle the LED if the new button state is HIGH
